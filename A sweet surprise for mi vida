       Youre the light that makes joy feels real in my life, a blessing that life created a soul as perfect, intelligent, sweet, kind, and geninue its the most beautiful way. All those moments that felt as rocks throwing at us, to make us fall apart, it actually made us stronger, more proud of our love. Each time one of us could be struggling we know we have each other as thats more than enough i dont want anything else for me than you. I will protect you for any harm that could happen, if you ever feel like life its too difficult i make sure to you remember youre not alone again, you have me and i will stay there even if everyone else tells me otherwise, i dont care about their opinions, i will choose you each time you can be sure of that. Sometimes i wish i could take your old pain away and make it mine, knowing that you had to pass tough situations to be the strong man you are its just unfair to think of, all those people that hurt you will get what they deserve. You said Im kind but when it comes to you, those intense feelings just tell me to wish them the worst. Thats how willing Im to make sure youre always healthy and happy mi vida. I Love u Talha‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
